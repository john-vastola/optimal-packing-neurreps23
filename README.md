# Code for "Optimal packing of attractor states in neural representations" (NeurReps 2023)

This repo contains code for a paper from [NeurReps](neurreps.org) 2023. All code for reproducing the figures from the paper is in a single, self-contained python notebook. Only fairly standard libraries (mostly numpy and matplotlib) are used.
